# ProofPay – Decentralized Payments with Soundness Proofs

## Category  
`defi`

## Summary  
**ProofPay** is a lightweight decentralized payment system that enables users to send and receive micro-payments instantly, with every transaction backed by a cryptographic proof verified through the **Soundness Layer**.  
The goal is to provide a fast, transparent, and secure way to handle on-chain payments that can be easily integrated into web or mobile applications.

## Integration with Soundness Layer  
- Every transaction generates a **proof** that is verified by the Soundness Layer.  
- The Soundness Layer ensures that only valid transactions are accepted.  
- This eliminates the risk of fake transactions and increases trust.  
- ProofPay can expose an **SDK** so other dApps, marketplaces, or games can plug into secure payments.

## Architecture  
- **Frontend**: Simple web/mobile UI for sending & receiving payments.  
- **Backend**: Manages wallets and addresses.  
- **Soundness Layer**: Verifies all transaction proofs before finalization.  
- **Database**: Stores only verified and confirmed transactions.  

User -> ProofPay UI -> Backend -> Soundness Layer (Proof Verification) -> Blockchain



## Roadmap / Milestones  
1. **Week 1–2**: Build a minimal payment UI.  
2. **Week 3–4**: Connect Soundness CLI for proof verification.  
3. **Week 5–6**: Run full integration on the testnet.  
4. **Week 7–8**: Release an SDK for external integration.
